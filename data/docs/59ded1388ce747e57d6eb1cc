LAS VEGAS SHOOTING COPYCAT THREATS: FBI ARRESTS NEW YORK MAN AND CHARLOTTESVILLE SCHOOLS LOCKED DOWN

A New York City man allegedly sent emails to a Denver company in which he threatened a “Las Vegas repeat,” presumably referring to the recent mass shooting there, while the FBI is investigating a social media post that expressed admiration for the shooter, Stephen Paddock, and said Charlottesville, Virginia, schools should be the next target.

According to a criminal complaint unsealed Wednesday, Victor Casillas, 34, invoked the Las Vegas shooting in an attempt to extort money from the Denver company—threatening to fly to Colorado and shoot company employees if it didn’t pay him $100.

The Las Vegas attack on October 1, when Paddock fatally shot 58 people who were attending a country music concert, has been called the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history.

Casillas, who lives in Manhattan, was arrested Tuesday night by FBI agents, according to a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York.

The company Casillas allegedly targeted markets a mobile app that relays sales offers from various retailers and gives users credits—which can be exchanged for money—if users refer others to the companies, the complaint states. (The complaint does not name the company.) Casillas opened about 14 accounts on the app in the past two years in an apparent attempt to fraudulently obtain referral bonuses, but when the company noticed his scheme, it deactivated his accounts on September 26, according to the complaint.

That decision apparently made Casillas furious, court papers state, and he fired off a string of emails that included frightening threats and even photos of submachine guns.
