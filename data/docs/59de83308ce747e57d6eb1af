A professor from Las Vegas has suggested Donald Trump must take some blame for the mass shooting which plagued the city because he has encouraged violence during his presidency.

The US was catapulted into a state of shock just over a week ago after a gunman opened fire on an outdoor country music event and killed 58 and injured more than 500.

Tessa Winkelmann, an assistant professor at the University of Nevada, works just minutes away from the strip where the killing spree took place.

Four days after the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history, Ms Winklemann told her history students people are likely to die because of Mr Trump’s tenure. She said she predicted President Trump’s election would cause death.

“Right when he got elected, I told my classes, three semesters ago, that some of us won’t be affected by this presidency, but others are going to die,” Ms Winkelmann said to her class on Thursday in a video obtained by the Las Vegas-Review Journal.
She added: "And we’ve seen this happen right? I don’t know that these events would have inevitably happened whether or not he got elected, but he has rhetorical powers every president has to encourage or to discourage [violence]. Right so far all he has done is to encourage violence." 

While Ms Winkelmann did not explicitly refer to the Vegas carnage in the video, she cited President Trump’s violent, aggressive threats towards North Korea as an example of how rhetoric can lead to violence.

She said: “And words, especially if they are coming from someone who is president, have consequences.”
