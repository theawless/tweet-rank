State and federal authorities are warning that con artists posing as family members of Las Vegas shooting victims are setting up fake Facebook and crowdfunding campaigns, hoping to siphon off donations intended for those killed or wounded in the attack.

Las Vegas Attorney General Adam Laxalt shut down a bogus Facebook page on Monday and said he is working with fundraising firm GoFundMe to track down other fraudulent donation sites.
"There continue to be sham charities and websites seeking to profit from this horrific tragedy," Laxalt said, while urging consumers to report websites and campaigns that they believe are suspicious.

Crooks habitually seek to exploit natural disasters and other tragedies, including the October 1 massacre at a music festival in Nevada, which killed at least 58 people and wounded hundreds of others in what is the deadliest shooting in modern U.S. history. Setting up overnight "charities" and bogus victim donation pages, criminals sometimes even use the names of real victims to attract financial contributions.

"Tugging at your heartstrings is a tried-and-true method scammers use to get to your wallet," said Emma Fletcher, a consumer education specialist with the Federal Trade Commission, in a consumer advisory issued Tuesday that warned of "suspicious requests for donations" related to the rampage in Las Vegas.
