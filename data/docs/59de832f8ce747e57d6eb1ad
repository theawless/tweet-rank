President Trump announced on Wednesday that $1 million, which will come from the Department of Justice, will be awarded to Las Vegas to aid law enforcement after the recent mass shooting in the city. 

"Happy to announce we are awarding $1M to Las Vegas - in order to help local law enforcement working OT to respond to last Sundayâ€™s tragedy," Trump tweeted.
The DOJ confirmed in a statement that its donation to the state of Nevada was drawing from emergency response funds to "help assist with the immediate costs of responding to the mass shooting in Las Vegas, Nevada."

"The grant funds announced today recognize the hard work and dedication of law enforcement officers across Las Vegas and the State of Nevada, who worked tirelessly in the wake of the tragic shooting last week," the statement says. 

Trump previously donated an identical sum to a number of charities to help victims affected by Hurricane Harvey, after thousands of Houston-area residents were displaced by the storm's severe flooding. 
The Las Vegas mass shooting was the deadliest in modern U.S. history, with 58 people killed and more than 500 wounded by a shooter who opened fire from a nearby hotel.

Law enforcement found the shooter dead in the hotel room along with a large stash of weapons and ammunition.
