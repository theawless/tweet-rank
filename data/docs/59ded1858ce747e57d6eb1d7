Las Vegas natives Imagine Dragons react to deadly shooting just after sold-out Hollywood Bowl show

As Las Vegas natives Imagine Dragons were relishing in a milestone moment in their career Sunday night at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles, tragedy was striking the band’s hometown.

The group, which has rapidly risen to arena headlining status over the past five years thanks to monster hits such as “Radioactive,” “It’s Time,” “Demons,” “On Top of the World,” “Believer” and “Thunder,” was enjoying the fruits of its labor in front of a sold-out Hollywood crowd and post show quickly learned of the mass shooting at the Route 91 Harvest Festival in Las Vegas.


The band took to Twitter, simply saying “devastated for Las Vegas. active shooter near Mandalay Bay. please please please seek cover and get away from the area.”

Imagine Dragons had just performed in front of a sold-out crowd at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas on Friday, Sept. 29 and brought with them a beautiful message of unity as they delivered their set at the Hollywood Bowl, the fourth stop on its Evolve World Tour. The jaunt wraps up at Honda Center in Anaheim on Thursday, Nov. 16.

“Music cuts through everything,” vocalist Dan Reynolds told the crowd after playing the show opener, “I Don’t Know Why.”

“It unites us,” he continued noting that he hoped everyone would open their hearts, minds, ears and really listen to one another.
