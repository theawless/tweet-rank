After Las Vegas shooting, Facebook and Google get the news wrong again
Both were promoting fake stories for hours, before eventually taking them down.

The worst mass shooting in modern US history took place last night in Las Vegas, where a gunman killed at least 58 people and injured more than 515 others, according to the latest reports. Not long after the unfortunate event, Facebook and Google began populating news stories on their respective platforms, as they often do. And, in what's become a problematic trend, some of the articles being highlighted and distributed to millions of people were from unreliable sources. This time, among them were a trolling thread on internet forum board 4chan and a completely false story from a far-right conspiracy website.

Just last month, Facebook launched its "Crisis Response" feature, which lets users let others know their status during a disaster like this one. It also displays links to articles and fundraising information. Unfortunately, earlier today the tool was plagued by spam and scam pages, and it took hours before Facebook cleaned that mess. That wasn't the only issue with Facebook's site either. The top of its News Stories feed had an article from the Gateway Pundit titled "Las Vegas Shooter Reportedly a Democrat Who Liked Rachel Maddow, MoveOn.org and Associated with Anti-Trump Army."

The Gateway Pundit has a reputation for spreading fake news, including the well-documented "Pizzagate" story, which falsely claimed that members of the Democratic Party were involved in a human-trafficking, child-sex operation during the 2016 US presidential election. As it turns out, the article about the Vegas shooter seen on Facebook also turned out to be incorrect. It has since been taken down, but not before it managed to go viral -- and Facebook should be partially to blame for that.
