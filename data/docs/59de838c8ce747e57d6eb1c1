Las Vegas community comes together one week after mass shooting


LAS VEGAS (KTNV) - Hundreds gathered at the corner of Las Vegas Boulevard and Sahara exactly one week after the deadliest mass shooting in recent U.S. history.

People hung flags, lit candles, listen to speakers, shook hands with police, grieved together, and began the recovery process.

"To show that we are still #VegasStrong because we're not going to let tragedy and fear win over our city," said Chelsey Morrison who came to the event with her husband and children.

13 Action News spoke with one man who lives two blocks from Mandalay Bay. When he and his wife heard the gunfire begin, they knew they needed to help.

"We both decided that we were going to bring people into our home to get them off the street," said Eric Schultz. "We ended up putting eight people in out apartment."

Earlier in the day, local artists came together at a downtown hair salon, Make Shift Union.

The artists painted, played the guitar, hung out, and tried to find the positives in last week's tragedy.

Make Shift Union donated 100% of Sunday's proceeds to the families of the victims.

Jacqueline Hill was also there selling gold and silver necklaces that say Las Vegas. She is donating her proceeds as well. If you want to buy one for $18, just head to her website.
