Golden Knights hold moving ceremony to honor Las Vegas shooting victims, first responders

LAS VEGAS — On a night when the community was supposed to celebrate the Vegas Golden Knights it was the Golden Knights celebrating the lives of others.

In a 40-minute pregame ceremony, the NHL’s newest team paid tribute to the victims of the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history and to the first responders whose actions saved many.

Instead of the normal player introductions associated with the franchise’s first home game, the Golden Knights introduced doctors, nurses, firemen, police officers and paramedics, who walked onto the ice accompanied by a player.

The PA announcer referred to the first responders as “our heroes” and “the best of human kind.”

The ceremony included a 58-second moment of silence to honor the 58 people killed when Stephen Paddock opened fire on an outdoor concert crowd from a hotel window on the Las Vegas Strip last week

Each of the victims’ names was superimposed on the ice during a moment of the silence.

All advertising was removed from the boards and replaced with the hashtag #VegasStrong. Golden Knights President Kerry Bubolz said every advertiser agreed unanimously to have their signs removed as a show of respect for ceremony.

At the start of the ceremony, players from opposing NHL teams were seen on the video screen sending a “Vegas Strong” message. The Las Vegas-based band Imagine Dragons, plus Adam Levine and Lee Brice, were among other celebrities with a prerecorded “Vegas Strong” message.
Survivors of the tragedy joined team owner Bill Foley at center ice for a ceremonial faceoff.
