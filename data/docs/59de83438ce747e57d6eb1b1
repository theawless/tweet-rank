Las Vegas shooting doesn't classify as 'terrorism'; Donald Trump's refusal to call it so is justifiedAs Americans recuperate from the initial shock and grief of Sunday's shootout in Las Vegas that killed 59 people, there has been a strong demand of condemning the crime as "an act of terrorism". President Donald Trump has been criticised widely for not "calling it what it is".

From singer Ariana Grande, whose concert in Manchester was also hit by a similar attack in May, to everyday Americans, people are urging US authorities to label the act as "terrorism". There's widespread condemnation of Trump for shrugging the Las Vegas shooter off as just another American psycho, while the President of United States is known to blast his predecessors and opponents for failing to "call it what it is" when the perpetrator was brown-skinned and/or a Muslim.


What's in a name?

The longing to label the massacre as something the global community absolutely detests is palpable and understandable. The term "terrorism", going by its generic understanding, elevates the perpetrator as more than a mere criminal; s/he is an enemy of the State for purposely waging a war against its citizens.

There's also the sense that the resistance in terming the Las Vegas shooting as "terrorism" stems from the fact that the shooter was a white male with no known links to Islam. Trump, a conservative, is often perceived to go softer on violence perpetrated by Right-wing groups and white supremacists, though he is unflinching in his condemnation of "radical Islam", a phenomenon which we are fond of calling "selective intolerance" here in India.
