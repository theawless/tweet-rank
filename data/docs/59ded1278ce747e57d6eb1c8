LAS VEGAS MASS SHOOTING
Sources: Vegas gunman had access to service elevator as perk

Las Vegas gunman Stephen Paddock had access to and used the service elevator at the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino in the days leading up to his attack on a country music festival, sources told ABC News.

Officials briefed on the investigation told ABC News that Paddock's access to the service elevator was a perk for high rollers. No further information about when and how he used the elevator has been released.

The revised timeline given by investigators for the Las Vegas massacre raises questions about whether better communication might have allowed police to respond more quickly and take out the gunman before he could kill and wound so many people.

On Monday, Sheriff Joe Lombardo said Paddock shot and wounded a Mandalay Bay hotel security guard outside his door and sprayed 200 bullets down the hall six minutes before he opened fire Oct. 1 from his high-rise suite on a crowd at a country music festival below.

That was a different account from the one police gave last week: that Paddock shot the unarmed guard, Jesus Campos, after unleashing his barrage of fire on the crowd, where 58 people were killed and hundreds injured.

The sheriff had previously hailed Campos as a "hero" whose arrival in the hallway may have led Paddock to stop firing. But on Monday, Lombardo said he didn't know what prompted Paddock to end the gunfire and take his own life.

How crucial were the minutes that elapsed before the massacre began?
