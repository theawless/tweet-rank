Cal State San Bernardino, community mourn student killed in Las Vegas mass shooting
As a community filed into Cal State San Bernardino’s student union Tuesday evening, a slideshow remembering Jordyn Rivera played on a projection screen.

For those there to mourn the fourth-year student killed in the Las Vegas mass shooting on Oct. 1, photos of Rivera smiling at baseball games, at school, beside family and friends offered a look at her 21 years.

Before a couple hundred attendees, Rivera was remembered by school officials, her youth minister and several friends.
CSUSB President Tomas D. Morales spoke of Rivera’s warmth, optimism, energy and kindness. During his opening remarks, Morales broke down in tears explaining how grief-stricken he and his university was – and still is – after hearing of Rivera’s death.

“As I stand before you, I am saddened by this tragic event that has brought us here,” said Brian Haynes, vice president for student affairs at CSUSB. “I am overwhelmed by the strength and support all of you have shown in recent days.”

Rivera, president of CSUSB’s Eta Sigma Gamma, was remembered for her positive attitude, effervescent smile and school pride.
