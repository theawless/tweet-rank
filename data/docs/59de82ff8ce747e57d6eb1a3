With 59 people killed, Sunday night’s mass shooting in Las Vegas marked the deadliest in modern U.S. history — and the death count is more likely to rise.

Shooter Stephen Paddock’s rampage at the Route 91 Harvest Festival outside the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino was not the deadliest shooting in U.S. history. That unfortunate title goes to the 1890 Wounded Knee Massacre left more 200 Native Americans dead. But it’s the deadliest of the modern era.

As mass shootings seemingly become more common, here are the ten deadliest shootings in modern U.S. history.
1. Las Vegas Shooting — At least 59 deaths

The shooting at a Las Vegas concert became the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history after at least 59 people were killed. More than 500 people were also injured.

2. Orlando Shooting — 49 deaths

Omar Mateen opened fire on the Pulse nightclub in Orlando on June 12, 2016. He killed 49 people before taking hostages and was shot and killed during a gun fight with police. Mateen was a U.S. citizen, and while ISIS claimed the attack, he did not seem to have communication with the terror group.

Florida Gov. called the shooting “an act of terror.”
