One was a man who died shielding his wife from gunfire on their wedding anniversary. Another was a city of Las Vegas employee who died in his boyfriend's arms. And two others were a veteran corrections officer and his girlfriend who died on the trip they had planned for weeks.

At least 58 people were killed and nearly 500 others were injured Sunday night, authorities say, when a gunman fired on an outdoor country musical festival from the 32nd floor of a Las Vegas hotel in the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history.

Andrea Castilla was holding hands with her sister, Athena, at the music festival when the gunfire erupted, according to a GoFundMe page set up by her family. She was shot in the head.
Her boyfriend, Derek Miller, Athena and her fianc√©, Shane Armstrong, carried Andrea out of the concert venue as bullets continued to rain down, according to the fundraising page. They stopped a passing truck to take her to a hospital, where she died.

"Her beautiful soul will live on forever," her father, Gus, wrote on Facebook. "I will think of her every day. ... I feel Andrea is now an angel in heaven."
In another post, her father added, "I will cry my self to sleep... Daddy misses you."
Castilla worked at Sephora in Huntington Beach, California. A company statement said she was "known to her colleagues ... for her vibrancy, liveliness, caring and consideration of others."
