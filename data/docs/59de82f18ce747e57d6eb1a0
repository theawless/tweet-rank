Police on Monday said the Las Vegas gunman shot a hotel security guard six minutes before he began shooting concertgoers from his hotel room at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino -- a striking change from an earlier police timeline detailing what happened.

Given that revised order of events, Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo said investigators do not yet know what made Stephen Paddock stop shooting, and they remain perplexed as to why he meticulously planned the shooting in the first place.
Here's what we learned about the investigation and the questions that remain unanswered in the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history.
Security guard was shot before mass shooting
Authorities said last week that security guard Jesus Campos had approached Paddock's room as the shooting was underway, diverting the gunman's attention. Authorities also said that after Paddock shot at Campos through the door of his room on the 32nd floor, the gunman didn't fire any more shots into the crowd.
However, Lombardo said Monday that Campos was shot in the leg at 9:59 p.m. on October 1. Six minutes later, Paddock began firing into the crowd at the Route 91 Harvest Festival, authorities said. Fifty-eight people were killed and nearly 500 were hurt.
He continued firing for nine to 11 minutes, and his final shots were fired at 10:15 p.m., according to police.
Officers reached the 32nd floor at 10:17 p.m., according to Lombardo's timeline. By the time a SWAT team used an explosive charge to enter the room at 11:20 p.m., Paddock was dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.
Lombardo said that Campos, upon being shot, immediately notified security of his situation, and his action helped identify the location of the suspect. In addition, Campos prevented a maintenance worker on the same floor from suffering injuries, the sheriff said.
Police did not know Campos was shot until they met him in the hallway of the 32nd floor after getting off the elevator, Lombardo said.
