Mandalay Bay executives question police timeline on Las Vegas shooting

A report from Las Vegas authorities that gunman Stephen Paddock fired a barrage of shots at a hotel security guard six minutes before unleashing a hailstorm of gunfire on concertgoers from his room at the Mandalay Bay hotel may not be accurate, the hotel says.

“We cannot be certain about the most recent timeline,” MGM Resorts International spokeswoman Debra DeShong said in a statement. "We believe what is currently being expressed may not be accurate.”

DeShong said the investigation into the rampage Oct. 1 that killed 58 people has "a lot of moving parts" and is continuing. 

"As evidenced by law enforcement briefings over the past week, many facts are still unverified and continue to change as events are under review," DeShong said.


Stephen Schuck, a building engineer at Mandalay Bay, on Wednesday told NBC News Today show he was on a higher floor the night of Paddock's rampage when he was called to check on a fire exit door that would not open.

He said the hallway on the 32nd floor where Paddock was holed up was quiet when he arrived.

"About a third of the way down the hallway and I started to hear shots go off," Schuck said, although they apparently were not directed into the hallway.
