Las Vegas shooting: Candles flicker, moods shift as Strip copes with tragedy

There’s one scene that repeats itself, night after night, mile after mile, in this city suddenly dotted with memorials. Cheerful people strolling down the Strip pass a small patch of candles and flowers, and they stop. Their faces tighten. They shuffle forward. Sometimes they glance down the Las Vegas Boulevard, toward the hotel where a few days earlier a man leaned out of broken windows and shot 58 people to death at a concert. 

Then they move on, bound for the lights of another casino. 

It’s those brief moments in between — the solemn stares, the heads slowly shaking, the quiet murmurings — in which the Las Vegas Strip finds itself now, almost one week after the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history. Pain has seeped into the infrastructure of this place, hiding in the cracks and showing itself only in small bursts.

The casinos are open, but extra security guards wave metal detectors and search random pieces of luggage. The oversized LED screens still make night feel like day, but instead of showing casino ads they all read “#VegasStrong.”

Bored-looking salespeople still hawk tickets, but demand for theater shows has dropped. People still drink and shout, but then they look all around, almost apologetically. 

“They can’t explain it to themselves,” Dotti Murphy said as she watched a family stare at a makeshift memorial and then scurry around it to see the famed Bellagio fountain show. “And they’re feeling guilty for having fun, because how many people are in the hospital? How many people died for no reason?”
