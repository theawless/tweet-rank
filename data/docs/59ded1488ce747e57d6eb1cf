After revelation that casino guard was shot before Las Vegas massacre began, unanswered questions loom

When the Las Vegas gunman arrived at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino late last month, he assembled “an armory” in his room, according to one of the police officers who went inside.

Authorities said Stephen Paddock, 64, had secreted nearly two dozen guns in his two-room suite on the 32nd floor. He also had stacks of ammunition, cameras, drills and computers as he methodically planned and carried out the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history.

But the first shots Paddock fired were not aimed at the country music festival far below. Instead, police now say, six minutes before Paddock aimed his guns at the concertgoers, he shot a hotel security guard who happened into his hallway on an unrelated call.

The new detail, which contradicts a significant element of the earlier timeline offered by police in the days since the shooting, raises additional questions about the law enforcement response to the massacre and why officers took as long as they did to arrive at Paddock’s gunshot-riddled door.

These questions come as investigators, who have scoured Paddock’s life in search of a motive since the Oct. 1 rampage, remain unable to explain why the avid gambler killed 58 people and injured hundreds more before shooting himself in the head.

“I’m frustrated,” Joseph Lombardo, the Las Vegas sheriff, said at a news briefing Monday night. “This individual purposefully hid his actions leading up to this event and it is difficult for us to find answers for those actions.”
