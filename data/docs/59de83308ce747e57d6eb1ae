President Trump and aides said Wednesday that the federal government would give $1 million to Las Vegas police to help offset overtime costs related to the investigation of the mass shooting earlier this month. 

"Happy to announce we are awarding $1M to Las Vegas - in order to help local law enforcement working OT to respond to last Sundayâ€™s tragedy," Trump said on Twitter.

In a written statement, the Justice Department said the money would come from emergency response funds within the Bureau of Justice Assistance. 

The funds "recognize the hard work and dedication of law enforcement officers across Las Vegas and the State of Nevada, who worked tirelessly in the wake of the tragic shooting last week," the Justice Department said.

The department said it is "continuing to work with Las Vegas officials to address law enforcement and public safety costs related to this tragedy."

The attack on a country music concert killed 58 people and wounded more than 500 others.

Since the Oct. 1 incident, in remarks at the White House as well as during a visit to Las Vegas, Trump has repeatedly praised the police and other first responders, saying more people would have died without their action.

"We also continue to pray for those grieving and wounded after the mass shooting attack in Las Vegas," Trump said at the White House on Wednesday.
