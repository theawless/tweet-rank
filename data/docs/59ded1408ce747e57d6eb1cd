New details about the man identified as the Las Vegas shooter who killed 58 people, Stephen Paddock, based on US media reports

New Delhi: Las Vegas police identified Stephen Paddock as the gunman who opened fire on a country music festival from the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino in the city, killing at least 58 people and leaving more than 500 wounded in the deadliest mass shooting in the US history.

The 64-year-old Paddock began shooting from two windows on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino just after 10pm local time on Sunday evening. A police team later found Paddock dead in his hotel room and officials believe he killed himself.

The US media unraveled information on Paddok after the Las Vegas shooting. Here’s what has been discovered so far:

he New York Times: “He (Paddock) stockpiled expensive firearms over the course of many months. Investigators have identified 47 firearms belonging to Mr. Paddock, including a dozen in his hotel suite that were enhanced to fire at an accelerated rate, and discovered a system of cameras Mr. Paddock set up to monitor the area around his location.

Paddock struck a jet fuel tank near McCarran International Airport with two rifle rounds, said Chris Jones, an airport spokesman, though a police official expressed doubt that he targeted it intentionally.”

The Washington Post: “He liked to bet big, wagering tens of thousands of dollars in a sitting. He owned homes in four states but preferred staying in casino hotels, sometimes for weeks at a time, as he worked the gambling machines… In the final years of his life, Stephen Paddock was living out his retirement in quiet obscurity. He liked country music, relatives said, and went to concerts like the Route 91 Harvest festival where he killed so many Sunday night.”
