NRA says 'nothing could have been done' to prevent Las Vegas shooting

America’s most powerful gun-rights lobbying group has claimed “nothing could have been done” to prevent the mass shooting in Las Vegas in which 58 people were killed and more than 500 injured.

In the aftermath of the shooting perpetrated by a 64-year-old former accountant, many have called on politicians to seize on the movement to demand tougher restrictions on guns.

Yet, a spokeswoman for the National Rifle Association (NRA), which endorsed Donald Trump and donated millions of dollars to his campaign, sought to dismiss such suggestions.

“There’s nothing that could have been done, unfortunately, to prevent this tragedy,” Dana Loesch told Fox News. 

She added: “I know this investigation is ongoing and I don’t want to get ahead of the law enforcement that’s involved in this right now, but usually with individuals like these there are some sort of red flags and I’m just curious what kind of vibe, what kind of red flags, this individual was putting out.”

Following the shooting, the White House said it was not the right time to discuss the issue of gun regulations. Mr Trump said the topic would be addressed “as time goes on”.
