ince the Las Vegas gunman opened fire from his 32nd-floor hotel suite, killing 58 people at a country music festival last week and injuring hundreds more before shooting himself, questions have swirled around the attack.

Investigators plumbing Stephen Paddock's life in search of answers have been so far unable to explain what motivated him to carry out the rampage, why he stopped shooting and whether he planned even more carnage beyond the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino.


In recent days, a new level of uncertainty has emerged in the case, as questions also emerged about the law enforcement response to the shooting after police revised their account of what happened before and during the massacre.

Ten days after the shooting, key details about what unfolded remain a mystery, while officials cannot seem to agree on basic facts about the timeline.

Police in Las Vegas, who had previously said Paddock shot a hotel security guard during the rampage, reversed course Monday and said the guard was actually wounded six minutes before the mass shooting began.

The revelation from Joseph Lombardo, the Las Vegas sheriff, gave way to a new round of questions, including when information about this shooting was relayed to hotel security and when — or if — that detail was then given to the local police. So far, neither the police or the hotel have offered any answers, and both sides have in fact suggested there could be future revisions to the timeline.
